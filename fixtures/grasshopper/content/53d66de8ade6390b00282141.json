To install `node-inspector`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g node-inspector\n```\n\nTo run node inspector you must use a path to the app, for example if you have an app in the `server` \ndirectory and it contains an `index.js` file as it's entry point:\n\n```bash\nnode-debug server\n```\n\nNote that the command is `node-debug`. If, for example, you wanted to debug \nvia grunt, you would need the path to grunt:\n\nThe direct method above or using a path to a js file is the easiest method. You can also try and debug\nthrough other parent apps. In each case, the path is needed:\n\n```bash\nnode-debug $(which grunt) server\n```\n\nFinally, debugging mocha seems error prone, but if you have to, you should use `_mocha` and not `mocha`:\n\n```bash\nnode-debug $(which _mocha)\n```\n\n"
