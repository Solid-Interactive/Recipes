[Example](http://solid-interactive.github.io/masseuse-examples/validation/)

* We would like to improve upon this.

* Each property has a corresponding error computed property.  

* The model has a 'hasError' property that is computed from the individual error properties.

* Ideally, we would like to do this:  
    * mix-in validation model
    * autogenerated error properties 
    * async validation
    * middleware-style list of validators in array
    * rivets components for common field types
    * the error is also the message
    * the model will have a 'motherError' property
